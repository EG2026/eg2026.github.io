**[Registration for Conference and Graduate School is now open!](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/registration.html)**

**[The Marathon Hostel still has some places left if you are looking for accommodation](https://marathonhostel.com/en/)**

**[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
___
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

<h2 id=doctoral_consortium>Doctoral Consortium</h2>
<div id=simple-static></div>











<p>

The Eurographics Doctoral Consortium is a networking event that provides PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics with an excellent opportunity to present their work and interact with distinguished and experienced researchers in the field. Participants will receive feedback and mentoring, as well as a fresh perspective from senior researchers outside their home institution. In addition, the Doctoral Consortium offers a unique forum for PhD students to share their work and experiences with their peers.

</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply?</h3>

<p>

PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics are encouraged to apply. We particularly welcome applications from students in the first half of their PhD, especially those who already have a clear research direction (possibly with some published results), as they have sufficient time ahead to benefit from participation in the Doctoral Consortium. Students who are close to completing their doctorate, or who have very recently finished, are also welcome to share their experience and discuss their ongoing research and future plans.

</p>

<p>

Applicants are strongly encouraged to consider submitting a poster of their work to the poster track in parallel.

</p>

<p>

Submission website: 

<a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026DC">Eurographics Submission and Review Management (SRM) system</a>.

</p>



<p>

Format: Submissions should follow the 

<a href="https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/">Eurographics authors’ guidelines</a>. 

A template is available 

<a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026DC/GetConferenceFile?fileID=18505">here</a>.

</p>



<p>

Eligible students who would like to participate in the Doctoral Consortium should submit the following documents as a single PDF file:

</p>



<ol>

  <li>

    <p><b>1. Research Statement:</b> A 3–4 page extended abstract summarizing the dissertation research, authored solely by the student. Submissions should <b>not</b> be anonymous. The use of figures is encouraged. This document should include:

    <ol>

      <li>· University doctoral program context (e.g., program duration/funding) in which the work is being conducted, including start date and expected graduation date;</li>

      <li>· Motivation that drives the dissertation research;</li>

      <li>· Research objectives and questions;</li>

      <li>· Background and related work that informs the author’s research;</li>

      <li>· Research approach, methodology, and proposed experiments (where appropriate);</li>

      <li>· Dissertation status and a description of the remaining work;</li>

      <li>· Current and expected contributions.</li>

    </ol>

	</p>

    <p>The research statement should transcend the scope of a single publication or project and instead focus on the general research theme or agenda for the student’s PhD thesis.</p>

  </li>



  <li>

    <p><b>2. Supervisor’s Letter of Support:</b> A one-page signed letter from the PhD student’s supervisor supporting their participation in the Doctoral Consortium. The letter should provide the following information:

    <ol>

      <li>· The student’s status with respect to the institution’s PhD requirements;</li>

      <li>· The expected date of thesis/dissertation defense or graduation;</li>

      <li>· Why attendance at the Doctoral Consortium would be particularly beneficial to the student;</li>

      <li>· What contributions the student is likely to make to the event if invited to attend.</li>

    </ol>

	</p>

	<p></p>

  </li>



  <li>

    <p><b>3. Curriculum Vitae:</b> A 1–2 page CV including a complete list of publications.</p>

  </li>

</ol>



<p>All three documents must be written in English.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="review-process">Review Process</h3>



<p>

The review process is single-anonymous. The review and acceptance decisions will take into account the following criteria:

</p>



<ol>

  <li>· Quality of the submission, including the potential contribution and impact of the research on the field of computer graphics, and the author’s stage of doctoral research;</li>

  <li>· The benefits of the consortium for the author’s PhD research;</li>

  <li>· The author’s contribution to the diversity of topics, backgrounds, and profiles represented in the Consortium.</li>

</ol>



<p>

Each accepted author will be paired with a panelist—a senior researcher in their area of study—with whom they will interact in a one-to-one mentoring session.

</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>

All authors of accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Consortium, where they will present their work to a panel of experts selected to best match the topics of the accepted submissions.

</p>



<p>

The Doctoral Consortium will be a closed event attended only by the authors and the panelists. Each author will begin with a short presentation (approximately 10 minutes), followed by a discussion with the panelists and other authors. Afterwards, there will be time for one-to-one discussions between each author and their assigned panelist.

</p>
