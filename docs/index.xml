      <description>Eurographics 2026 will take place in a large multiplex movie theater. The “Cineplex” in Aachen has an impressive installation of a full 4K stereo projection setup with a 200 square meter screen – of which only very few exist in Europe. We would like to use this unique opportunity and invite participants of EG 2026 to submit their own stereo video clips and have them presented in a special session at the conference.</description>

      <description>The Eurographics 2026 Tutorials Committee invites you to propose high-quality presentations and materials on the technical background of a given subject or demonstrating its potential creative applications. Tutorials are intended to show what can be done, but even more importantly, how this is done and what kind of tools can be used to do it. In a proposal for a tutorial, you should consider that tutorial attendees come from diverse backgrounds, ranging from research and development to education and application.</description>

      <description>Join us at Eurographics 2026 for a timely panel on Fair Access to Compute: The Emerging Inequality in the Age of AI. As modern computer graphics and AI research increasingly depend on large-scale computational resources, a new kind of inequality is taking shape. Today, groundbreaking results often come from institutions or companies with access to vast GPU clusters, while talented researchers—especially students and early-career academics at smaller universities—may struggle to compete despite having equally strong ideas.</description>

      <description>Physical attendance in combination with appropriate presentation of accepted work is at the very heart of a scientific conference. This year, at EG26, we would like to make explicit what this entails, so that both authors and audience get the best experience and the integrity of scientific discussion is maintained. Hence,&#xA;· If authors of accepted work do not present in person the work will not be published. Remote presentation or pre-recorded material is not considered a presentation.</description>

      <description>Computer graphics can do far more than just reduce its own environmental footprint - and in this panel at Eurographics 2026, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how. With leading experts from academia and industry sharing their insights and your questions driving the conversation, this session will highlight the intersections where computer graphics can make a real-world impact. Together, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss interdisciplinary opportunities where core graphics research topics can complement and advance fields like climate science, sustainability engineering or environmental studies.</description>
