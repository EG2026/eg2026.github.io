Eurographics 2026 will take place in a large multiplex movie theater. The “Cineplex” in Aachen has an impressive installation of a full 4K stereo projection setup with a 200 square meter screen – of which only very few exist in Europe. We would like to use this unique opportunity and invite participants of EG 2026 to submit their own stereo video clips and have them presented in a special session at the conference. Videos and animations can be of an artistic kind, be entertaining, or showcase your latest research results – or all three at once. We will provide information and support to generate the videos so that the stereo perspective as well as the file formats meet the technical requirements. We can organize a public vote and will award a best video prize to the winner.


At this stage, we are not yet calling for actual submissions but rather for your “expression of interest”. If you consider submitting a video of 1 to 3 min please send us a short message (to stereo_video_reel_EG2026@rwth-graphics.de) by the end of January 2026. If we receive a sufficient number of replies we will invite submissions. This two step process is implemented since we would like to first assess if there is enough interest to contribute to the stereo session.


Please use the following template for your reply:

1. · would you consider submitting a stereo video to EG2026? (Yes / Maybe / No)
2. · approximate video length
3. · video genre (paper, thesis, course, research demo, artistic, funny, …)


We look forward to hearing from you!

The stereo video reel organization team
