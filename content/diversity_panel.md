Join us at Eurographics 2026 for a timely panel on **Fair Access to Compute: The Emerging Inequality in the Age of AI**. As modern computer graphics and AI research increasingly depend on large-scale computational resources, a new kind of inequality is taking shape. Today, groundbreaking results often come from institutions or companies with access to vast GPU clusters, while talented researchers—especially students and early-career academics at smaller universities—may struggle to compete despite having equally strong ideas.

This panel will examine whether our community is unintentionally reinforcing a “compute-rich vs compute-poor” divide, and what we can do to ensure that innovation in graphics remains accessible to all. We will discuss concrete steps the field can take: designing fairer reproducibility standards, creating limited-compute submission categories, managing expectations around training budgets, and supporting research that does not rely on industrial-scale compute. Our goal is to foster a more equitable research ecosystem—one where creativity and insight matter more than access to hardware.

Whether you are a researcher navigating compute limitations, a member of industry shaping the next generation of tools, or simply someone invested in building a fair and inclusive graphics community, we invite you to join the conversation and help shape practical solutions.

This year’s panel consists of 4 outstanding researchers who engage in initiatives promoting inclusion and equal access within the computer graphics community to ensure broader participation from underrepresented groups.
