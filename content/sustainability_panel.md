Computer graphics can do far more than just reduce its own environmental footprint - and in this panel at Eurographics 2026, we'll explore how. With leading experts from academia and industry sharing their insights and your questions driving the conversation, this session will highlight the intersections where computer graphics can make a real-world impact. Together, we'll discuss interdisciplinary opportunities where core graphics research topics can complement and advance fields like climate science, sustainability engineering or environmental studies. Such collaborations can spark new research directions and build future-oriented partnerships. Join us to discuss how we want to shape the future of our field - and how computer graphics can become a driving force for a more environmentally cautious future.

Our invited panelists: TBA
