<p>

The Eurographics Doctoral Consortium is a networking event that provides PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics with an excellent opportunity to present their work and interact with distinguished and experienced researchers in the field. Participants will receive feedback and mentoring, as well as a fresh perspective from senior researchers outside their home institution. In addition, the Doctoral Consortium offers a unique forum for PhD students to share their work and experiences with their peers.

</p>

<h3 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply?</h3>

<p>

PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics are encouraged to apply. We particularly welcome applications from students in the first half of their PhD, especially those who already have a clear research direction (possibly with some published results), as they have sufficient time ahead to benefit from participation in the Doctoral Consortium. Students who are close to completing their doctorate, or who have very recently finished, are also welcome to share their experience and discuss their ongoing research and future plans.

</p>

<p>

Applicants are strongly encouraged to consider submitting a poster of their work to the poster track in parallel.

<p>

Eligible students who would like to participate in the Doctoral Consortium should submit the following documents as a single PDF file:

</p>



<ol>

  <li>

    <p><b>1. Research Statement:</b> A 3–4 page extended abstract summarizing the dissertation research, authored solely by the student. Submissions should <b>not</b> be anonymous. The use of figures is encouraged. This document should include:

    <ol>

      <li>· University doctoral program context (e.g., program duration/funding) in which the work is being conducted, including start date and expected graduation date;</li>

      <li>· Motivation that drives the dissertation research;</li>

      <li>· Research objectives and questions;</li>

      <li>· Background and related work that informs the author’s research;</li>

      <li>· Research approach, methodology, and proposed experiments (where appropriate);</li>

      <li>· Dissertation status and a description of the remaining work;</li>

      <li>· Current and expected contributions.</li>

    </ol>

	</p>

    <p>The research statement should transcend the scope of a single publication or project and instead focus on the general research theme or agenda for the student’s PhD thesis.</p>

  </li>



  <li>

    <p><b>2. Supervisor’s Letter of Support:</b> A one-page signed letter from the PhD student’s supervisor supporting their participation in the Doctoral Consortium. The letter should provide the following information:

    <ol>

      <li>· The student’s status with respect to the institution’s PhD requirements;</li>

      <li>· The expected date of thesis/dissertation defense or graduation;</li>

      <li>· Why attendance at the Doctoral Consortium would be particularly beneficial to the student;</li>

      <li>· What contributions the student is likely to make to the event if invited to attend.</li>

    </ol>

	</p>

	<p></p>

  </li>

    <p><b>3. Curriculum Vitae:</b> A 1–2 page CV including a complete list of publications.</p>

  </li>

</ol>



<p>All three documents must be written in English.</p>

<h3 id="review-process">Review Process</h3>



<p>

The review process is single-anonymous. The review and acceptance decisions will take into account the following criteria:

</p>



<ol>

  <li>· Quality of the submission, including the potential contribution and impact of the research on the field of computer graphics, and the author’s stage of doctoral research;</li>

  <li>· The benefits of the consortium for the author’s PhD research;</li>

  <li>· The author’s contribution to the diversity of topics, backgrounds, and profiles represented in the Consortium.</li>

</ol>



<p>

Each accepted author will be paired with a panelist—a senior researcher in their area of study—with whom they will interact in a one-to-one mentoring session.

</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>

All authors of accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Consortium, where they will present their work to a panel of experts selected to best match the topics of the accepted submissions.

</p>



<p>

The Doctoral Consortium will be a closed event attended only by the authors and the panelists. Each author will begin with a short presentation (approximately 10 minutes), followed by a discussion with the panelists and other authors. Afterwards, there will be time for one-to-one discussions between each author and their assigned panelist.
